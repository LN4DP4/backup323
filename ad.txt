Purpose of study
Art, craft and design embody some of the highest forms of human creativity. A high-quality
art and design education should engage, inspire and challenge pupils, equipping them with
the knowledge and skills to experiment, invent and create their own works of art, craft and
design. As pupils progress, they should be able to think critically and develop a more
rigorous understanding of art and design. They should also know how art and design both
reflect and shape our history, and contribute to the culture, creativity and wealth of our
nation.

Aims
The national curriculum for art and design aims to ensure that all pupils:

* produce creative work, exploring their ideas and recording their experiences

* become proficient in drawing, painting, sculpture and other art, craft and design
techniques

* evaluate and analyse creative works using the language of art, craft and design

* know about great artists, craft makers and designers, and understand the historical and
cultural development of their art forms.

Attainment targets
By the end of key stage 3, pupils are expected to know, apply and understand the matters,
skills and processes specified in the programme of study.
