Purpose of study

A high-quality physical education curriculum inspires all pupils to succeed and excel in
competitive sport and other physically-demanding activities. It should provide opportunities
for pupils to become physically confident in a way which supports their health and fitness.
Opportunities to compete in sport and other activities build character and help to embed
values such as fairness and respect.

Aims

* develop competence to excel in a broad range of physical activities

* are physically active for sustained periods of time

* engage in competitive sports and activities

* lead healthy, active lives.

Attainment targets
By the end of each key stage, pupils are expected to know, apply and understand the
matters, skills and processes specified in the relevant programme of study.
