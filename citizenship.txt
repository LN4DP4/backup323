Purpose of study
A high-quality citizenship education helps to provide pupils with knowledge, skills and
understanding to prepare them to play a full and active part in society. In particular,
citizenship education should foster pupilsâ€™ keen awareness and understanding of
democracy, government and how laws are made and upheld. Teaching should equip
pupils with the skills and knowledge to explore political and social issues critically, to weigh
evidence, debate and make reasoned arguments. It should also prepare pupils to take
their place in society as responsible citizens, manage their money well and make sound
financial decisions.

Aims
The national curriculum for citizenship aims to ensure that all pupils:

* acquire a sound knowledge and understanding of how the United Kingdom is
governed, its political system and how citizens participate actively in its democratic
systems of government

* develop a sound knowledge and understanding of the role of law and the justice
system in our society and how laws are shaped and enforced

* develop an interest in, and commitment to, participation in volunteering as well as other
forms of responsible activity, that they will take with them into adulthood

* are equipped with the skills to think critically and debate political questions, to enable
them to manage their money on a day-to-day basis, and plan for future financial needs.

Attainment targets
By the end of each key stage, pupils are expected to know, apply and understand the
matters, skills and processes specified in the relevant programme of study.
