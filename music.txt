Purpose of study
Music is a universal language that embodies one of the highest forms of creativity. A highquality music education should engage and inspire pupils to develop a love of music and
their talent as musicians, and so increase their self-confidence, creativity and sense of
achievement. As pupils progress, they should develop a critical engagement with music,
allowing them to compose, and to listen with discrimination to the best in the musical
canon.

Aims
The national curriculum for music aims to ensure that all pupils:

* perform, listen to, review and evaluate music across a range of historical periods,
genres, styles and traditions, including the works of the great composers and
musicians

* learn to sing and to use their voices, to create and compose music on their own and
with others, have the opportunity to learn a musical instrument, use technology
appropriately and have the opportunity to progress to the next level of musical
excellence

* understand and explore how music is created, produced and communicated, including
through the inter-related dimensions: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture,
structure and appropriate musical notations.

Attainment targets
By the end of key stage 3, pupils are expected to know, apply and understand the matters,
skills and processes specified in the programme of study.
