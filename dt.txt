Purpose of study
Design and technology is an inspiring, rigorous and practical subject. Using creativity and
imagination, pupils design and make products that solve real and relevant problems within
a variety of contexts, considering their own and othersâ€™ needs, wants and values. They
acquire a broad range of subject knowledge and draw on disciplines such as mathematics,
science, engineering, computing and art. Pupils learn how to take risks, becoming
resourceful, innovative, enterprising and capable citizens. Through the evaluation of past
and present design and technology, they develop a critical understanding of its impact on
daily life and the wider world. High-quality design and technology education makes an
essential contribution to the creativity, culture, wealth and well-being of the nation.

Aims
The national curriculum for design and technology aims to ensure that all pupils:

* develop the creative, technical and practical expertise needed to perform everyday
tasks confidently and to participate successfully in an increasingly technological world

* build and apply a repertoire of knowledge, understanding and skills in order to design
and make high-quality prototypes and products for a wide range of users

* critique, evaluate and test their ideas and products and the work of others

* understand and apply the principles of nutrition and learn how to cook.

Attainment targets
By the end of key stage 3, pupils are expected to know, apply and understand the matters,
skills and processes specified in the programme of study.
