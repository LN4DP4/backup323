Purpose of study
A high-quality computing education equips pupils to use computational thinking and
creativity to understand and change the world. Computing has deep links with
mathematics, science, and design and technology, and provides insights into both natural
and artificial systems. The core of computing is computer science, in which pupils are
taught the principles of information and computation, how digital systems work, and how to
put this knowledge to use through programming. Building on this knowledge and
understanding, pupils are equipped to use information technology to create programs,
systems and a range of content. Computing also ensures that pupils become digitally
literate – able to use, and express themselves and develop their ideas through, information
and communication technology – at a level suitable for the future workplace and as active
participants in a digital world.

Aims
The national curriculum for computing aims to ensure that all pupils:

* can understand and apply the fundamental principles and concepts of computer
science, including abstraction, logic, algorithms and data representation

* can analyse problems in computational terms, and have repeated practical experience
of writing computer programs in order to solve such problems

* can evaluate and apply information technology, including new or unfamiliar
technologies, analytically to solve problems

* are responsible, competent, confident and creative users of information and
communication technology.

Attainment targets
By the end of each key stage, pupils are expected to know, apply and understand the
matters, skills and processes specified in the relevant programme of study
